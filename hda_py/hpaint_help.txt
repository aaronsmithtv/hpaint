"""A tool for drawing with geometry in the viewport."""

The Hpaint SOP is a viewport drawing utility for Houdini, allowing you to digitally paint on any geometry.

== Recorded attributes ==

Hpaint will record almost all of the attributes provided by the [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke], with some added extras.

Point:
    `arclen`:
        The length of the initial stroke line.

    `surface_distance_add`:
        The value of the Stroke Surface Distance parameter applied to the stroke.


Prim:
    `seg_id`:
        The primitive segment number within the current stroke.

    `stroke_id`:
        The stroke ID counted within the current Hpaint SOP.


@parameters
=== Stroke Utilities ===

Clear Stroke Buffer:
    Removes all strokes currently held in the stroke buffer.

Save Buffer to Disk:
    Saves all strokes currently held in the stroke buffer to the file path specified.

    WARNING:
        Saving the buffer to disk will not overwrite the currently loaded disk file, but will merge into it.

File Path:
    The path on disk to save to.

    TIP:
        Use frame-evaluating expressions such as `$F` to create frame-by-frame animations!

        :box:
            #display: rounded green

            Combine this with the timeshift SOP and template flag to give yourself basic onion-skinning functionality.

        :box:
            #display: rounded green

            For simple expression functionality, name your expressions with their associated name (e.g Eye_open).

            Link your file name to an Ordered Menu parameter, and key between your expressions for a Toonboom-esque method!

Clear Stroke File:
    Pressing [Icon:PARTS/delete_x] clears the specified buffer disk file of all strokes, but does not delete the file itself.

Swap Disk File into Buffer:
    Swaps strokes from the specified disk file into the stroke buffer, clearing the original disk file.

    TIP:
        Swapping the disk file into the buffer allows you to erase unwanted strokes from a cache on disk, and then save it back again using Save Buffer to Disk.

Action By Group:
    Enables unix-style pattern matching for Houdini groups on `Clear Stroke Buffer`, `Swap Disk File into Buffer` and `Clear Stroke File`. For example, typing `l*` and clearing the stroke buffer would clear all strokes that have houdini groups starting with l.

=== Stroke Settings ===

Stroke Colour:
    Used to control the `Cd` and `Alpha` of resulting strokes.

Stroke Radius:
    Used to control the width of resulting strokes.

Stroke Surface Distance:
    Used to control the distance of resulting strokes from the surface of the input geometry.

Stroke Texture:
    If enabled, used to specify the shader texture applied to all visible strokes.

Stroke Group:
    If enabled, used to specify the prim group of resulting strokes.

=== Tool Settings ===

Enable Screen Draw:
    #id: hp_sd_enable
    Toggles the drawable object from the input geometry to a grid in camera space.

Screen Draw Depth Method:
    #id: hp_sd_type
    Controls the way that depth is used when drawing a stroke in Screen Draw mode. `Once` will create strokes at the sampled viewport depth of the current viewport geometry, whereas `Continuous` will draw at the depth specified in the Screen Draw Distance parameter.

Screen Draw Distance:
    #id: hp_sd_dist
    The distance of the camera grid, from the selected camera.

Enable Stroke Pressure:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in resulting strokes' construction.

Enable Pressure Width:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in calculating resulting strokes' width.

Enable Pressure Alpha:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in calculating resulting strokes' alpha.

Stroke Subdivs:
    Used to control the level of subdivision applied to resulting strokes.

Disable Geometry Mask:
    #id: disable_geo_mask
    A toggle for disabling the automated stroke masking with a geometry input. When Geometry Masking is disabled, all strokes that leave the surface of the geometry will be evaluated at the depth plane of the last surface position, angled by the current camera view. When the stroke returns to the surface of the geometry, it is re-evaluated in a way that keeps the look of the stroke natural.

Output Curves Only:
    #id: output_curves
    A toggle for drawing only curves with HPaint. When enabled, strokes are not turned into their UVed card counterparts and are instead left as polylines.

=== Anim Settings ===

Display Nearest Frame:
    Used to toggle how a time-dependent stroke cache is displayed. Using `Nearest Method`, snap an animation to either its' last valid frame, or next valid frame.

Ghost if Empty Frame:
    If the underlying file cache is currently visible as the last or next frame, but does not match the current frame, a ghosting effect (multiplication of `Alpha`) is applied.

=== Visualization ===

Hide Guide Geometry:
    Removes the guide geometry from the viewport when using HPaint.

Use Full Geometry As Guide:
    Replaces the visualizer wireframe guide geometry with the original input geometry.

    NOTE:
        A default Prim `Cd` and Point `Alpha` attrib value will be applied to the input geometry, if either attribute does not exist.

Guide Colour:
    The colour and alpha value of the geometry wireframe guide.
